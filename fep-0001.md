## Summary

The `fan build` tool is designed to simplify starting new Fantom projects, as
well as handle boiler-plate and scaffolding-type code and directory generation.

## Goals

 * Create a new command line tool to:
    - Stub a new `PathEnv` project directory and supporting files
    - Stub a new pod source tree and supporting files
 * Officially recommend new projects be created in their own `PathEnv`
 * Enhance `docIntro` chapter to utilize `fan build` in examples

## Non-Goals

This proposal does not attempt to formalize the role and function of the
`fan.props` file outside of creating a `PathEnv`.

## Motivation

The default behavior of Fantom is to install compiled pods into the global
`lib/` folder. However most modern projects utilize `PathEnv` to organize their
code separately. While the processes for accomplishing this are documented,
this is not explicitly recommended, nor is there any comprehensive examples.

A lesser problem is there exists a fair amount of boilerplate to create both
new `PathEnv` folders and creating new source trees for pods within these
projects. This results in either copy-and-pasting files from other projects,
and/or setting up IDE macros.

This proposal aims to solve both problems by introducing a new command line
tool that is easy to understand and use for both beginner and expert users.

In addition, several new FEP's will depend on `PathEnv` configuration, so this
is a foundational FEP for future Fantom enhancements.

## Description

A new `build::Main` class will be created with the follwing command:

    # create new PathEnv and pod source tree
    fan build init <pod-name>

It was considered whether these commands should be created in a new top-level
pod (such as `init`), which could support future functionality and possibly
APIs for adding features downstream.

That remains a viable path, however, it is outside the scope of this FEP. This
enhancement is focused on adding only the core needs to bootstrap new Fantom
projects. By bundling these tools in the `build` pod we allow both new and
third party tools space to create, enhance (and even deprecate) the standard
init tools.

### Directory Structure

This proposal standardizes the following directory structure for Fantom
projects:

    project/                 # top-level project name
    │
    ├── fan.props            # file to trigger PathEnv
    ├── etc/                 # project local etc/ dir
    ├── lib/                 # project local lib/ dir
    └── src/                 # project local src/ dir
        │
        ├── build.fan        # top-level BuildGroup script
        │
        └── podA/            # podA: source sub-directory
        │   ├── build.fan    # podA: build script
        │   ├── fan/         # podA: fan source directory
        │   └── test/        # podA: test source directory (optional)
        │
        └── podB/            # podB: source sub-directory
            ├── build.fan    # podB: build script
            ├── fan/         # podB: fan source directory
            └── test/        # podB: test source directory (optional)


### The `init` Command

This is the default mechanism used to create new "projects".

Example use:

    $ fan build init hello
    Created new env 'hello/'
    Created new pod 'src/hello/'
    INIT SUCCESS!

Example output (created under current working dir):

    hello/
    ├── fan.props
    ├── etc/
    ├── lib/
    └── src/
        ├── build.fan
        └── hello/
            ├── build.fan
            ├── fan/
            └── test/

Several directories and files are created:

 1. A top level `hello/` project directory

 2. `fan.props`: an empty file that tells Fantom this folder is a new `PathEnv`

 3. Directory stubs for `etc/`, `lib/`, and `src/`

 4. A directory stub `src/hello/` for a `hello` pod with associated `build.fan` script

 5. A top level `build.fan` `BuildGroup` script

NOTE: No source files are created in this process.

By default a single pod is always created that matches the project name.  If
additional pods are needed, run the `init` command under the project directory
with the desired pod names:

    $ cd hello
    $ fan build init world
    Created new pod 'src/world/'
    Remember to add 'world/build.fan' to 'src/build.fan'!
    INIT SUCCESS!

Example output:

    hello/
    ├── fan.props
    ├── etc/
    ├── lib/
    └── src/
        ├── build.fan
        ├── hello/
        │   ├── build.fan
        │   ├── fan/
        │   └── test/
        └── world/
            ├── build.fan
            ├── fan/
            └── test/

Note you will need to manually add the new `world/build.fan` script to the top
level `build.fan` script.

### BuildGroup `build.fan` Script

The proposal specifies that all Fantom projects contain a top-level build
script under `src/build.fan`.  The default script generated will include the
inital pod.  As new pods are added, they need to be manually added to this
script.

```fantom
#! /usr/bin/env fan

using build

class Build : BuildGroup
{
  new make()
  {
    childrenScripts =
    [
      `hello/build.fan`,
    ]
  }
}
```

### Pod `build.fan` Scripts

The `init` command will generate a minimial `build.fan` script for each pod it
creates.  This script will document what configuration and meta-data a
developer may want to add:

```fantom
#! /usr/bin/env fan

using build

class Build : build::BuildPod
{
  new make()
  {
    podName = "hello"
    summary = "Description of this pod"
    version = Version("1.0")
    // These values are optional, but recommended
    // See: http://fantom.org/doc/docLang/Pods#meta
    // meta = [
    //   "org.name":     "My Org",
    //   "org.uri":      "http://myorg.org/",
    //   "proj.name":    "My Project",
    //   "proj.uri":     "http://myproj.org/",
    //   "license.name": "Apache License 2.0",
    //   "vcs.name":     "Git",
    //   "vcs.uri":      "https://github.com/myorg/myproj"
    // ]
    depends = ["sys 1.0"]
    srcDirs = [`fan/`]
    // resDirs  = [,]
    // javaDirs = [,]
    // jsDirs   = [,]
    // docApi   = false   // defaults to 'true'
    // docSrc   = true    // defaults to 'false'
  }
}
```

### Enhance Documentation

As part of this propoal, we also want to update our documention to indicate
using `init` is the standard method for creating new Fantom projects.

Two sections will be updated, the first in `docIntro::HelloWorld`.  Here will
mostly maintain the existin content, but rework the examples to use `init`:

    $ fan build init hello

The second will be to add a new section to `docTools::Build` describing the
`init` command tool usage and behavoir.
