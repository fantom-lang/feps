# Fantom Enhancement Proposals

## What is a FEP?

FEP stands for Fantom Enhancement Proposal.  A FEP is a design document
providing information to the Fantom community, or describing a new feature for
Fantom or its processes or environment.  The FEP should provide a concise
technical specification of the feature and a rationale for the feature.

We intend FEPs to be the primary mechanisms for proposing major new features,
for collecting community input on an issue, and for documenting the design
decisions that have gone into Fantom.  The FEP author is responsible for
building consensus within the community and documenting dissenting opinions.

Because the FEPs are maintained as text files in a versioned repository, their
revision history is the historical record of the feature proposal.
